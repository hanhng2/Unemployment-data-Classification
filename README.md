# Unemployment-data-Classification

# ACS DATASET
In this project, our focus lies in exploring the unemployment rate among four distinct groups of females within the civilian demographic actively searching for employment opportunities.

#The three groups are:

25 to 29 years old
30 to 34 years old
35 to 44 years old
45 to 54 years old

Originaly, we are interested in the data before and after Covid. However, the API calls are restricted to data prior to 2019, we'll narrow our focus to the dataset specifically from the year 2019 for this project.
